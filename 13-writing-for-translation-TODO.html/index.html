  <li class="active">13 writing for translation TODO.html</li>
</ol>

<p>Polder Knowledge serves users in different countries and territories, not just the Netherlands. As our user base grows, it becomes more and more important that our content is accessible to people around the world.</p>
<p>We call the process of writing copy for translation “internationalization.” This section will address things you can do to help international audiences, including translators, better comprehend your text.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Our Knowledge Base is available to all emproyees in English, with more languages in development. Sometimes other pieces of content will be translated as well.</p>
<p>We try to write all of our content in standard, straightforward English that can be understood by users with limited English proficiency. It's much easier for a translator to clearly communicate ideas written in straightforward, uncomplicated sentences.</p>
<p>Here are some guiding principles for writing for international audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use <a href="../04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md/#header-3-active-voice">active voice</a>.</strong> We always aim for this, but it's especially important when writing for translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the subject-verb-object sentence structure.</strong> It’s not used by all languages, but it’s widely recognized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use positive words when talking about positive situations.</strong> For example, because a question like “Don’t you think she did a great job?” begins with a negative word, a non-native English speaker may interpret its implication as negative. A better version would be “She did a good job, right?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<p>When writing for international audiences, we generally follow what's outlined in the <a href="../02-voice-and-tone.html/">Voice and tone</a> and <a href="../04-grammar-and-mechanics.html/">Grammar and mechanics</a> sections. But in this section more than others, some style points contradict what's stated elsewhere in the guide. If you’re writing something to be translated, the guidelines in this section should take precedence.</p>
<h3 id="consider-cultural-differences">Consider cultural differences</h3>
<p>Polder Knowledge’s voice conversational and informal. However, in some cultures, informal text may be considered offensive. Check with your translator to see if this is the case for the particular language you’re writing for.</p>
<p>The translation company should give the option to translate in a formal or informal tone, if the language allows for it. (For example, in Spanish, it is possible to write informally where tú = you or formally where usted = you.)</p>
<p>When writing text that will be translated, be careful about making references to things of local or regional importance. These may not be recognizable to readers outside the Netherlands.</p>
<h3 id="prioritize-clarity">Prioritize clarity</h3>
<p>Keep your copy brief, but don’t sacrifice clarity for brevity. You may need to repeat or add words to make the meaning of your sentences clear to a translator.</p>
<h4 id="repeat-verbs-that-have-multiple-subjects">Repeat verbs that have multiple subjects.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: Customers who have ordered online can pick-up their food at the cashier. Walk-in customers should stop by the cashier to order their food.</li>
<li>No: Customers who have ordered online or who are walk-ins should stop at the cashier to order or pick-up their food.</li>
</ul>

<li>No: Mandrill sends transactional emails, but not MailChimp.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="repeat-markers-in-a-list-or-series">Repeat markers in a list or series</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: Use MailChimp to send email campaigns, to manage your mailing lists, and to integrate with other applications.</li>
<li>No: Use MailChimp to send email campaigns, manage your mailing lists, and integrate with other applications.</li>

<h4 id="leave-in-words-like-then-a-the-to-and-that-even-if-you-think-they-could-be-cut">Leave in words like “then,” “a,” “the,” “to,” and “that," even if you think they could be cut</h4>

</ul>
<h3 id="avoid-ambiguity-and-confusion">Avoid ambiguity and confusion</h3>
<p>Many words, parts of speech, and grammar mechanics we don’t think twice about have the potential to cause confusion for translators and non-native English speakers. Here are some of the big trouble spots to avoid.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-unclear-pronoun-references">Avoid unclear pronoun references</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: Many believe that buying a list of email addresses and sending to the list through Polder Knowledge is okay. Such action can actually cause high of rates abuse, bounces, and unsubscribes. Purchasing a list and sending to it may cause your account to be suspended.</li>
<li>No: Many believe that buying a list of email addresses and sending to the list through Polder Knowledge is okay. This can actually cause high rates of abuse, bounces, and unsubscribes. It can ultimately cause your account to be suspended.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="avoid-ing-words">Avoid -ing words</h4>
<p>In English, many different types of words end in -ing: nouns, adjectives, progressive verbs, etc. But a translator who is a non-native English speaker may not be able to recognize the distinctions and may try to translate them all in the same way.</p>
<p>Because of this, we want to avoid -ing words when possible. One exception to this rule is words like “graphing calculator” and “riding lawnmower,” where the -ing word is part of a noun’s name and can’t be worked around.</p>
<p>Here are some other cases where you might see -ing words, and suggestions for how to edit around them.</p>
<h4 id="gerunds">Gerunds</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: In this article we will talk about list subscriber collection.</li>
<li>No: In this article we will talk about getting list subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="adjectives">Adjectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: At the top of the page, there is Mark with a smile on his face.</li>
<li>No: At the top of the page, there is a smiling Mark.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="parts-of-verbs">Parts of verbs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: Several developers are currently working on that feature.</li>
<li>No: Several developers are working on that feature. (When you can’t easily avoid the -ing word, it may help to add an adverb to clarify the meaning.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="parts-of-phrases-modifying-nouns">Parts of phrases modifying nouns</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes: From our backyard, we could hear the planes that took off from the airport.</li>
<li>No: From our backyard, we could hear the planes taking off from the airport.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-words-and-mechanics-to-avoid">Other words and mechanics to avoid</h4>
<ul>
<li>Slang, idioms, and cliches</li>
<li>Contractions (English contractions may not be recognizable to all translators)</li>
