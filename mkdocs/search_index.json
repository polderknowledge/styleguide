This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Polder Knowledge. To learn more about how we adapt our tone for different situations, check out our \nVoice and Tone guide\n.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.\n\n\nYour tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you\u2019re addressing. You wouldn\u2019t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who\u2019s scared or upset as you would with someone who\u2019s laughing.\n\n\nThe same is true for Polder Knowledge. Our voice doesn\u2019t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.\n\n\nHere  you can find a nice \nvideo\n over the actual usage of your voice ;).\n\n\nVoice\n\n\nPolder Knowledge\u2019s voice is human. It\u2019s familiar, friendly, and straightforward. Our priority is explaining our products and helping our users get their work done so they can get on with their lives. We want to educate people without patronizing, confusing or upsetting them.\n\n\nOne way to think of our voice is to compare what it is to what it isn\u2019t. Polder Knowledge\u2019s voice is:\n\n\n\n\nFun but not silly\n\n\nConfident but not cocky\n\n\nSmart but not stodgy\n\n\nInformal but not sloppy\n\n\nHelpful but not overbearing\n\n\nExpert but not bossy\n\n\nWeird but not inappropriate\n\n\n\n\nTone\n\n\nPolder Knowledge\u2019s tone is usually informal, but it\u2019s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you\u2019re writing, consider the reader\u2019s state of mind. Do the have trouble working with one of our poducts? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Are they curious about a post on soicial media? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.\n\n\nPolder Knowledge has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it\u2019s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don\u2019t go out of your way to make a joke\u2014forced humor can be worse than none at all.

This section will lay out our house style, which applies to all of our content unless otherwise noted in this guide. (We cover a lot of ground in this section\u2014the search feature will help if you're looking for something in particular.)\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nWrite for all readers.\n Some people will read every word you write. Others will just skim. Help everyone read better by grouping related ideas together and using descriptive headers and subheaders.\n\n\nFocus your message.\n Create a hierarchy of information. Lead with the main point or the most important content, in sentences, paragraphs, sections, and pages.\n\n\nBe concise.\n Use short words and sentences. Avoid unnecessary modifiers.\n\n\nBe specific.\n Avoid vague language. Cut the fluff.\n\n\nBe consistent.\n Stick to the copy patterns and style points outlined in this guide.\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nAbbreviations and acronyms\n\n\nIf there\u2019s a chance your reader won\u2019t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time you mention it. Then use the short version for all other references. If the abbreviation isn\u2019t clearly related to the full version, specify in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\nFirst use: Network Operations Center\n\n\nSecond use: NOC\n\n\nFirst use: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n\n\nSecond use: UTC\n\n\n\n\nIf the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like API or HTML, use it instead (and don\u2019t worry about spelling it out).\n\n\nActive voice\n\n\nUse active voice. Avoid passive voice.\n\n\nIn active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.\n\n\n\n\nYes: Marti logged into the account.\n\n\nNo: The account was logged into by Marti.\n\n\n\n\nWords like \u201cwas\u201d and \u201cby\u201d may indicate that you\u2019re writing in passive voice. Scan for these words and rework sentences where they appear.\n\n\nOne exception is when you want to specifically emphasize the action over the subject. In some cases, this is fine.\n\n\n\n\nYour account was flagged by our abuse team.\n\n\n\n\nCapitalization\n\n\nWe use a few different forms of capitalization. Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word.\n\n\nWhen writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase.\n\n\n\n\nfreddie@Polder Knowledge.com\n\n\nPolder Knowledge.com\n\n\n\n\nDon't capitalize random words in the middle of sentences. Here are some words that we never capitalize in a sentence. For more, see the \nWord List\n.\n\n\n\n\nwebsite\n\n\ninternet\n\n\nonline\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nContractions\n\n\nThey\u2019re great! They give your writing an informal, friendly tone. In most cases, use them as you see fit. Avoid them if you're writing content that will be \ntranslated for an international audience\n.\n\n\nEmoji\n\n\nEmoji are a fun way to add humor and visual interest to your writing, but use them infrequently and deliberately.\n\n\nNumbers\n\n\nSpell out a number when it begins a sentence. Otherwise, use the numeral.

This section lays out our style in regards to these web elements, and explains our approach to the tricky art of SEO.\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nAlt text\n\n\nAlt text is a way to label images, and it's especially important for people who can\u2019t see the images on our website. Alt text should describe the image in a brief sentence or two.\n\n\nFor more on how and why we use alt text, read the \nAccessibility\n section.\n\n\nButtons\n\n\nButtons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. Capitalize every word, including articles. It\u2019s OK to use an ampersand in button copy.\n\n\nStandard website buttons include:\n\n\n\n\nLog In\n\n\nSign Up Free\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nEmail Us\n\n\n\n\nCheckboxes\n\n\nUse sentence case for checkboxes.\n\n\nDrop-down menus\n\n\nUse title case for menu names and sentence case for menu items.\n\n\nForms\n\n\nForm titles should clearly and quickly explain the purpose of the form.\n\n\nUse title case for form titles and sentence case for form fields.\n\n\nKeep forms as short as possible.\n\n\nOnly request information that we need and intend to use. Don\u2019t ask for information that could be considered private or personal, including gender. If you need to ask for gender, provide a field the user can fill in on their own, not a drop-down menu. \n\n\nHeadings and subheadings\n\n\nHeadings and subheadings organize content for readers. Be generous and descriptive.\n\n\nHeadings (H1) give people a taste of what they\u2019re about to read. Use them for page and blog titles.\n\n\nSubheadings (H2, H3, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable.\n\n\nHeadings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An H2 will nestle under H1, an H2 under H3, and on down.)\n\n\nInclude the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main point of the content.\n\n\nUse title case, unless the heading is a punctuated sentence. If the heading is a punctuated sentence, use sentence case. Use sentence case for subheadings regardless of end punctuation.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nProvide a link whenever you\u2019re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.\n\n\nDon\u2019t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:\n\n\n\n\nYes: Read the \nautomation guide\n for details.\n\n\nNo: Read \nthe automation guide\n for details.\n\n\n\n\nIf a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don\u2019t link the punctuation mark.\n\n\nDon\u2019t say things like \u201cClick here!\u201d or \u201cClick for more information\u201d or \u201cRead this.\u201d Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.\n\n\nLinks should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they\u2019re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state. When setting the hover state of links, be sure to include focus state as well, to help readers using assistive technologies and touch devices.\n\n\nLists\n\n\nUse lists to present steps, groups, or sets of information. Give context for the list with a brief introduction. Number lists when the order is important, like when you\u2019re describing steps of a process. Don\u2019t use numbers when the list\u2019s order doesn\u2019t matter.\u2028\n\n\nIf one of the list items is a complete sentence, use proper punctuation and capitalization on all of the items. If list items are not complete sentences, don\u2019t use punctuation, but do capitalize the first word of each item.\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nUse title case for main or global navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation.\n\n\nNavigation links should be clear and concise.\n\n\nRadio Buttons\n\n\nUse title case for headings and sentence case for button fields.\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n\nSometimes a long piece of copy lends itself to a list of related links at the end. Don\u2019t go overboard\u20144 is usually plenty.\n\n\nRelated articles should appear in a logical order, following the step down/step up rule: The first article should be a step down in complexity from the current article. The second one should be a step up in complexity to a more advanced article.\n\n\nIf you can, avoid repeating links from the body text in related articles.\n\n\nTitles\n\n\nTitles organize pages and guide readers. A title appears at the beginning of a page or section and briefly describes the content that follows.\n\n\nTitles are (you guessed it) in title case.\n\n\nDon\u2019t use punctuation in a title unless the title is a question.\n\n\nSEO\n\n\nWe write for humans, not machines. We don't use gross SEO techniques like keyword stuffing to bump search results. But we also want to make it easy for people and search engines to find and share our content. Here are some not-icky ways to do this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganize your page around one topic. Use clear, descriptive terms in titles and headings that relate to the topic at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse descriptive headings to structure your page and highlight important information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive every image descriptive alt text.",

            "text": "At Polder Knowledge, technical content is mostly written by the technical content team. It appears in the Knowlege Base, throughout the our products, and in a few other locations. This section will lay out the guiding principles of technical content, discuss the main types of technical content, and outline the process of writing and editing technical articles.\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nSomeone reading technical content is usually looking to answer a specific question. That question might be broad or narrowly-focused, but either way our goal is to provide answers without distraction.\n\n\nFor each project, consider your audience\u2019s background, goal, and current mood. Ask these questions:\n\n\n\n\nIs the reader a prospective user, a new user, or an experienced user?\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the reader? To complete a task? To research a topic?\n\n\nIs the reader in the middle of a task? Are they in a hurry? Could they be frustrated?\n\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t want to overload a reader with unnecessary information, choices to make, or complex ideas or phrases, when we don\u2019t have to. This is particularly critical when a user may be new and/or frustrated. When relevant, prime the reader with a brief outline of an article\u2019s focus in an introductory paragraph or section, and stick to the topic at hand. Keep sentences, paragraphs, and procedural steps focused and concise.\n\n\nTypes of technical content\n\n\nTechnical content articles vary in target audience, goal, and tone. Polder Knowledge technical content is built from 8 types, which serve different purposes and readers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Template\n\n\nUser Type\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\n\nall\n\n\nContext.\n Make connections between Polder Knowledge products and teh client as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheat Sheet\n\n\nintermediate, advanced\n\n\nReference.\n Include all available scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nprospective, new\n\n\nOverview.\n Include brief outline of topic, uses, benefits, and related topics. Use links to best practices, cheat sheets, and feature overviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\nall\n\n\nEducation.\n Provide digestible information about critical legal policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathfinder\n\n\nprospective, new, intermediate\n\n\nOrientation.\n Bundle topics and provide links to relevant tutorials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nnew, intermediate, advanced\n\n\nSupport.\n Outline expected behavior and include potential causes of unexpected behavior; group by cause or topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTutorial\n\n\nnew, intermediate\n\n\nGuidance.\n Briefly describe a task, provide a roadmap and pre-requisites, and clear step-by-step instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nnew, intermediate, advanced\n\n\nAssurance.\n Outline warning type, explain why something happened, and include next steps for users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nDrafting technical content\n\n\nBefore you begin writing a new article, reach out to a subject matter expert at Polder Knowledge (like an engineer, tester, designer, researcher, or technical support advisor) to get as much information as possible. You may only use a small portion of what you learn, but it helps to have more information than you need to decide where to focus your article.\n\n\nConsider how many articles are needed and what article types will best describe a new feature or tasks to the user.\n\n\nOutline your article, then write a draft. Stay in touch with your subject matter expert and revise as needed for accuracy, consistency, and length.\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re happy with a draft, pass it to another technical writer for peer review. Then show it to a lead technical writer for additional review and revisions. For new content or highly complex content, send last draft to your subject matter expert for final approval.\n\n\nWriting technical content\n\n\nWhen writing technical content, follow the style points outlined in the \nVoice and tone\n and \nGrammar and mechanics\n sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.\n\n\nStay relevant to the title\n\n\nWhen a user clicks the title of an article, they expect to find the answer they want. Don\u2019t stray too far from the title or topic at hand. Use links to make related content available. If you find you\u2019re getting too far from the intended topic, then you may need to create a separate but related article.\n\n\nKeep headlines and paragraphs short and scannable\n\n\nFocused users often scan an article for the part that will answer their particular question. Be sure headlines are short, descriptive, and parallel, to facilitate scanning.\n\n\nUse second-person and describe actions to a user\n\n\nTechnical content talks to users when support agents can\u2019t.\n\n\nStrive for simplicity and clarity\n\n\nBe as clear as possible. Use simple words and phrases, avoid gerunds and hard-to-translate idioms or words, focus on the specific task, limit the number of sentences per paragraph. If you must include edge cases or tangentially related information, set it aside in a Before You Start list or Notes field.\n\n\nProvide context through embedded screenshots and GIFs\n\n\nScreenshots and GIFs may not be necessary for every article or process, but can be helpful to orient new users. Crop screenshots tightly around the action to focus attention.\n\n\nEditing technical content\n\n\nWe edit technical content based on three goals:\n\n\nDigestibility\n\n- Cut or tighten redundancies, gerunds, adverbs, and passive constructions.\n- Use the simplest word.\n- Limit paragraphs to three sentences.\n\n\nConsistency\n\n- Use the labels and terminology used in the Polder Knowledge products and services.\n- Use specific, active verbs for certain tasks.\n- Choose basic words and phrases to facilitate consistency across translated content.\n\n\nHelpfulness\n\n- Stay conversational, using contractions when appropriate.\n- Avoid qualifiers that muddy meaning.\n- Express understanding when appropriate.\n- Craft clear transitions from section to section to orient the reader.\n\n\nFormatting technical content\n\n\nTechnical content uses organization, capitalization, and other formatting to help convey meaning. Although different articles are organized differently, some formatting tips are consistent throughout all technical content.\n\n\nOrdered Lists\n\n\nOnly use ordered lists for step-by-step instructions. Separate steps into logical chunks, with no more than two related actions per step. When additional explanation or a screenshot is necessary, use a line break inside the list item.\n\n\nUnordered Lists\n\n\nUse unordered lists to display examples, or multiple notes in a Notes block. If an unordered list comprises more than 10 items, use a table instead.",

Consider how many articles are needed and what article types will best describe a new feature or tasks to the user.  Outline your article, then write a draft. Stay in touch with your subject matter expert and revise as needed for accuracy, consistency, and length.  When you\u2019re happy with a draft, pass it to another technical writer for peer review.

Most of our legal content is written by the legal department with help from the communications and legal team. This section gives a general overview of the types of legal content we publish and how those documents are written.\n\n\nFor information about laws that apply to non-legal content, see the \nCopyright and trademark\n section.\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nThe way we write, review, and publish legal content is different than how we do many other kinds of writing at Polder Knowledge. The most important difference is that all legal content either starts with or passes through the legal team.\n\n\nBut that doesn't mean legal content has to be difficult to read. We try to present our legal information in the most pleasant way possible. Our goals for Polder Knowledge's legal content are:\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy.\n Our first and foremost concern is that we present the correct information in a truthful way.\n\n\nClarity.\n We try to avoid legal jargon and overly formal wording. Our users need to understand the agreement they\u2019re making with us.\n\n\nSuccinctness.\n We want our users to read and understand our legal documents, while also respecting their time.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of legal content\n\n\nWe publish several types of legal documents, each with their own writing processes and goals.\n\n\nPublic legal documents\n\n\nWe keep these in one place on our \nlegal page\n:\n\n\nAll of our public legal documents, and any changes to those documents, are drafted by our in-house legal team. When new legal documents are published or edited, we notify all our users of the updates and provide a window for them to object before the new terms go into effect.\n\n\nPublic communications\n\n\nOccasionally we may have to publish communications about security, privacy, and other corporate issues. This could come in the form of an email to users, a blog post, a public statement, or a press release.\n\n\nThe communications team works with the legal team to write and publish these documents, and the executive team reviews them.\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nWhen writing legal content, generally follow the style points outlined in the \nVoice and tone\n and \nGrammar and mechanics\n sections. Here are some more general considerations, too.\n\n\nStart with the facts\n\n\nWe have some standard language that we use for common issues or requests, but since legal content is so fact-specific, we start there before getting into structure and format. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t see many templates for our legal content.\n\n\nUse plain language\n\n\nLegal content is serious business, so the tone is slightly more formal than most of our content. That said, we want all of our users to be able to understand our legal content. So whenever possible, we use plain language rather than legal jargon.\n\n\nInstead of: \u201cIf an individual purports, and has the legal authority, to sign these Terms of Use electronically on behalf of an employer or client then that individual represents and warrants that they have full authority to bind the entity herein to the terms of this hereof agreement\u201d\n\n\nWe say: \u201cIf you sign up on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.\u201d\n\n\nThere are some legal terms we have to include because either there\u2019s not a sufficient plain language alternative, or case law or statute dictates that term has to be used for the contract to hold up in court. For example, sometimes we need to say \u201crepresent and warrant\u201d instead of \u201cconfirm\u201d or \u201cagree.\u201d If we use those terms, we can provide an example or quick definition to help people understand what they\u2019re reading. We can't avoid all legal terminology, but we can pare it down to what's necessary.\n\n\nSome companies have complicated terms and write plain-language summaries so people can understand the agreement. We don\u2019t summarize our legal content, but instead try to write the terms themselves in plain language. We use a sidebar to provide examples or links to further reading for people who want more context.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nUsing plain language for the terms you define up front can make legal documents easier to read. You\u2019ve probably read contracts that say something like \u201cThe Corporation\u201d or \u201cThe User\u201d throughout, instead of \u201cwe\u201d (meaning the company) and \u201cyou\u201d (meaning the user who is agreeing to the terms). There\u2019s a quick fix for that. At the beginning of the document, say something like:\n\n\n\n\nPolder Knowledge is owned and operated by Polder Knowledfe Group BV (\u201cPolder Knowledge,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d). As a user of the Service or a representative of an entity that\u2019s a user of the Service, you're a \u201cMember\u201d according to this agreement (or \u201cyou\u201d).\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, you\u2019re free to use \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d throughout the rest of the agreement. That simple change makes the document much friendlier to read.\n\n\nContractions\n\n\nWe use contractions in many of our legal documents, which makes them sound more human and flow better with the rest of our content. Contracting words doesn't affect the validity of an agreement. Following our \ninternationalization guidelines\n, we avoid contractions if we're writing legal content that will be translated.\n\n\nNever offer legal advice\n\n\nWhile we want to inform our users about legal issues related to their use of Polder Knowledge, we can\u2019t offer them legal advice. Sometimes it\u2019s a fine line. The legal department will check for this in their content review.",

But as devices shrink and the inbox evolves, our oldest tip is still the most important: Only send when you have something to say.\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nOur email newsletters help empower and inform Polder Knowledge customers. Here are the most common types of content we send by email:\n\n\n\n\nProduct and feature announcements\n\n\nTips for getting the most out of existing products and features\n\n\nRegular monthly newsletters\n\n\nIndustry-based newsletters\n\n\nSystem alerts about changes to functionality or scheduled maintenance\n\n\nInternal newsletters\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nEmail newsletters generally follow the style points outlined in the \nVoice and tone\n and \nGrammar and mechanics\n sections. Here are some additional considerations.\n\n\nConsider all elements\n\n\nEvery email newsletter is made up of the following elements. Make sure they\u2019re all in place before clicking send:\n\n\nFrom name\n\n\nThis is usually the company or team\u2019s name. It identifies the sender in the recipient's inbox.\n\n\nSubject line\n\n\nKeep your subject line descriptive. There's no perfect length, but some email clients display only the first words. Tell\u2014don't sell\u2014what's inside. Subject lines should be in title case. (Note that this is different from a headline, which you may want to include in the campaign itself.)\n\n\nPreheader text\n\n\nThe top line of your campaign appears beside each subject line in the inbox. Provide the info readers need when they\u2019re deciding if they should open.\n\n\nBody copy\n\n\nKeep your content concise. Write with a clear purpose, and connect each paragraph to your main idea. Add images when they\u2019re helpful.\n\n\nCall to action\n\n\nMake the next step clear. Whether you\u2019re asking people to buy something, read something, share something, or respond to something, offer a clear direction to close your message so readers know what to do next.\n\n\nFooter\n\n\nAll newsletters follow our can-spam rules. Include an unsubscribe link, mailing address, and permission reminder in the footer of each newsletter.\n\n\nConsider your perspective\n\n\nWhen sending an email newsletter from Polder Knowledge, use the third person \u201cwe.\u201d When sending a newsletter as an individual, use the first person.\n\n\nUse a hierarchy\n\n\nMost readers will be scanning your emails or viewing them on a small screen. Put the most important information first.\n\n\nAvoid unnecessary links\n\n\nMore than 50 percent of emails are read on a mobile device. Limit links to the most important resources to focus your call to action and prevent errant taps on smaller screens.\n\n\nUse alt text\n\n\nSome email clients disable images by default. Include an alt tag to describe the information in the image for people who aren\u2019t able to see it.\n\n\nSegment your audience\n\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to send to millions of users at once, but it\u2019s doubtful that every subscriber is interested in every topic. Segment your list to find a particular audience that\u2019s likely to react.\n\n\nOnce you've selected an audience, adjust the language to fit their needs. For example, users who developed custom integrations are more likely to understand and appreciate direct, technical terms.\n\n\nTest your campaigns\n\n\nUse the preview mode to begin, and run an Inbox Inspection to see your newsletter in different email clients. Read your campaign out loud to yourself, then send a test to a coworker for a second look.",

Writing for accessibility goes way beyond making everything on the page available as text. It also affects the way you organize content and guide readers through a page. Depending on the audience and country, there may be laws governing the level of accessibility required. At minimum, an accessible version should be available. Accessibility includes users of all mental and physical capacities, and those who haven\u2019t had their coffee yet.\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nWe write for a diverse audience of readers who all interact with our content in different ways. We aim to make our content accessible to anyone using a screen reader, keyboard navigation, or Braille interface, and to users of all cognitive capabilities.\n\n\nAs you write, consider the following:\n\n\n\n\nWould this language make sense to someone who doesn\u2019t work here?\n\n\nCould someone quickly scan this document and understand the material?\n\n\nIf someone can\u2019t see the colors, images or video, is the message still clear?\n\n\nIs the markup clean and structured?\n\n\nMobile devices with accessibility features are increasingly becoming core communication tools, does this work well on them?\n\n\n\n\nMany of the best practices for writing for accessibility echo those for \nwriting technical content\n, with the added complexity of markup, syntax, and structure.\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nAvoid directional language\n\n\nAvoid directional instructions and any language that requires the reader to see the layout or design of the page. This is helpful for many reasons, including layout changes on mobile.\n\n\n\n\nYes: \u201cSelect from these options,\u201d (with the steps listed after the title)\n\n\nNo: \u201cSelect from the options in the right sidebar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nUse headers\n\n\nHeaders should always be nested and consecutive. Never skip a header level for styling reasons. To help group sections, be sure the page title is H1, top-level sections are H2s, and subsequent inside those are H3 and beyond. Avoid excessive nesting.\n\n\nEmploy a hierarchy\n\n\nPut the most important information first. Place similar topics in the same paragraph, and clearly separate different topics with headings.\n\n\nStarting with a simple outline that includes key messages can help you create a hierarchy and organize your ideas in a logical way. This improves scannability and encourages better understanding.\n\n\nMake true lists instead of using a paragraph or line breaks.\n\n\nLabel forms\n\n\nLabel inputs with clear names, and use appropriate tags. Think carefully about what fields are necessary, and especially which ones you mark as required. Label required fields clearly. The shorter the form, the better.\n\n\nUse descriptive links\n\n\nLinks should provide information on the associated action or destination. Try to avoid \u201cclick here\u201d or \u201clearn more.\u201d\n\n\nUse plain language\n\n\nWrite short sentences and use familiar words. Avoid jargon and slang. If you need to use an abbreviation or acronym that people may not understand, explain what it means on first reference.\n\n\nUse alt text\n\n\nThe alt tag is the most basic form of image description, and it should be included on all images. The language will depend on the purpose of the image:\n\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s a creative photo or supports a story, describe the image in detail in a brief caption.\n\n\nIf the image is serving a specific function, describe what\u2019s inside the image in detail. People who don\u2019t see the image should come away with the same information as if they had.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re sharing a chart or graph, include the data in the alt text so people have all the important information.\n\n\n\n\nEach browser handles alt tags differently. Supplement images with standard captions when possible.\n\n\nMake sure closed captioning is available\n\n\nClosed captioning or transcripts should be available for all videos. The information presented in videos should also be available in other formats.\n\n\nBe mindful of visual elements\n\n\nAim for high contrast between your font and background colors.

            "text": "Polder Knowledge serves users in different countries and territories, not just the Netherlands. As our user base grows, it becomes more and more important that our content is accessible to people around the world.\n\n\nWe call the process of writing copy for translation \u201cinternationalization.\u201d This section will address things you can do to help international audiences, including translators, better comprehend your text.\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nOur Knowledge Base is available to all emproyees in English, with more languages in development. Sometimes other pieces of content will be translated as well.\n\n\nWe try to write all of our content in standard, straightforward English that can be understood by users with limited English proficiency. It's much easier for a translator to clearly communicate ideas written in straightforward, uncomplicated sentences.\n\n\nHere are some guiding principles for writing for international audiences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \nactive voice\n.\n We always aim for this, but it's especially important when writing for translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the subject-verb-object sentence structure.\n It\u2019s not used by all languages, but it\u2019s widely recognized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse positive words when talking about positive situations.\n For example, because a question like \u201cDon\u2019t you think she did a great job?\u201d begins with a negative word, a non-native English speaker may interpret its implication as negative. A better version would be \u201cShe did a good job, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nWhen writing for international audiences, we generally follow what's outlined in the \nVoice and tone\n and \nGrammar and mechanics\n sections. But in this section more than others, some style points contradict what's stated elsewhere in the guide. If you\u2019re writing something to be translated, the guidelines in this section should take precedence.\n\n\nConsider cultural differences\n\n\nPolder Knowledge\u2019s voice conversational and informal. However, in some cultures, informal text may be considered offensive. Check with your translator to see if this is the case for the particular language you\u2019re writing for.\n\n\nThe translation company should give the option to translate in a formal or informal tone, if the language allows for it. (For example, in Spanish, it is possible to write informally where t\u00fa = you or formally where usted = you.)\n\n\nWhen writing text that will be translated, be careful about making references to things of local or regional importance. These may not be recognizable to readers outside the Netherlands.\n\n\nPrioritize clarity\n\n\nKeep your copy brief, but don\u2019t sacrifice clarity for brevity. You may need to repeat or add words to make the meaning of your sentences clear to a translator.\n\n\nRepeat verbs that have multiple subjects.\n\n\n\n\nYes: Customers who have ordered online can pick-up their food at the cashier. Walk-in customers should stop by the cashier to order their food.\n\n\nNo: Customers who have ordered online or who are walk-ins should stop at the cashier to order or pick-up their food.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat helping verbs belonging to multiple verbs\n\n\n\n\nYes: Polder Knowledge can send your campaign on the fly or can schedule your campaign to go out at a set time.\n\n\nNo: Polder Knowledge can send your campaign on the fly or schedule your campaign to got out at a set time.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat subjects and verbs\n\n\n\n\nYes: Mandrill sends transactional emails, but MailChimp does not.\n\n\nNo: Mandrill sends transactional emails, but not MailChimp.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat markers in a list or series\n\n\n\n\nYes: Use MailChimp to send email campaigns, to manage your mailing lists, and to integrate with other applications.\n\n\nNo: Use MailChimp to send email campaigns, manage your mailing lists, and integrate with other applications.\n\n\n\n\nLeave in words like \u201cthen,\u201d \u201ca,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cto,\u201d and \u201cthat,\" even if you think they could be cut\n\n\n\n\nYes: If there is not a list set up in your Polder Knowledge account, then you\u2019ll need to create a list before sending your first campaign.\n\n\nNo: If there is not a list set up in your Polder Knowledge account, you\u2019ll need to create a list before sending your first campaign.\n\n\nYes: When sending a campaign, it is necessary to have a \u201cFrom:\u201d name, a \u201cFrom:\u201d address, and a subject line.\n\n\nNo: When sending a campaign, it is necessary to have a \u201cFrom:\u201d name, \u201cFrom:\u201d address, and subject line.\n\n\nYes: Be sure that you are truly ready to send your campaign before clicking the \u201cSend Now\u201d button.\n\n\nNo: Be sure you are truly ready to send your campaign before clicking the \u201cSend Now\u201d button.\n\n\n\n\nAvoid ambiguity and confusion\n\n\nMany words, parts of speech, and grammar mechanics we don\u2019t think twice about have the potential to cause confusion for translators and non-native English speakers. Here are some of the big trouble spots to avoid.\n\n\nAvoid unclear pronoun references\n\n\n\n\nYes: Many believe that buying a list of email addresses and sending to the list through Polder Knowledge is okay. Such action can actually cause high of rates abuse, bounces, and unsubscribes. Purchasing a list and sending to it may cause your account to be suspended.\n\n\nNo: Many believe that buying a list of email addresses and sending to the list through Polder Knowledge is okay.

Use the subject-verb-object sentence structure.  It\u2019s not used by all languages, but it\u2019s widely recognized.    Use positive words when talking about positive situations.

            "text": "Copyright is a bundle of exclusive legal rights that vary depending on the type of work. A copyright owner can grant some or all of those rights to others through a license. This section will lay out our approach to copyrights, trademarks, and Creative Commons licenses.\n\n\nBasics\n\n\nCopyright protection applies to any original works that are fixed in a tangible medium. This includes works like drawings, recordings of a song, short stories, or paintings, but not something like a garden, since it will grow and change by nature. Copyright does not cover facts, ideas, names, or characters.\n\n\nCopyright protection begins when the work is first created and it doesn\u2019t require any formal filings. However, to enforce a copyright in the US, you need to register the work with the US Copyright Office. (For further clarity, check out their \nFAQ\n page, which is full of gems like \n\u201cHow do I protect my sighting of Elvis?\u201d\n)\n\n\nCopyright notice on the work is not required but it \nis\n recommended, since it cuts off a defense of \ninnocent infringement\n.\n\n\nCopyright at Polder Knowlege\n\n\nCopyright law applies to nearly every piece of content we create at Polder Knowledge, from our website to our blog posts to the gifts we make for our users. We display proper\u2014and prominent\u2014copyright notice on our website site and ony other content we produce.\n\n\nAt minimum, these copyright notices read, \u201c\n Polder Knowledge [YEAR].\u201d or \u201c\n Polder Knowledge Group [YEAR].\u201d\n\n\nAt the bottom of every page of our website, we also include a longer notice to make it clear that all rights are reserved and our marks are registered: \u201c\n Polder Knowledge 2016\u201d\n\n\nOther creators\u2019 copyrights\n\n\nWe respect the copyright of other creators. If we want to use someone else\u2019s copyrighted work, we have to obtain a license from the owners.\n\n\nA copyright license spells out these terms:\n\n\n\n\nWhere we can use the work\n\n\nHow long we can use it for\n\n\nHow much we\u2019ll pay them for the use\n\n\nWhether or not we\u2019re the only ones who can use the work\n\n\nWhat we can do with the work\n\n\nAny restrictions on our use (for example, that we can use it online but not on a billboard)\n\n\n\n\nA common license will read something like this:\n\n\n\u201cYou grant Polder Knowledge a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free license to display, distribute, and publish the Work in our marketing in any medium now known or later developed.\u201d\n\n\nIf you need to get a copyright license for work at Polder Knowledge or if someone outside of Polder Knowledge asks to use our copyrighted work, please contact the legal team.\n\n\nSocial media and copyright\n\n\nThis is an area where the letter of the law and common practice sometimes differ.\n\n\nSocial media posts often include copyrighted elements like pictures, gifs, or pieces of writing. If you\u2019re using a copyrighted element in a commercial manner on social media, you should request permission from the copyright holder. Since Polder Knowledge is a company, we defer to the position that our use will be perceived as commercial. But if you\u2019re using it in a more informative or commentary way, like sharing a meme to indicate how you feel about a news story, you may not need to request permission.\n\n\nRegardless, you should always link to the source of the copyrighted element you\u2019re using, and never make it look like you created work that belongs to someone else.\n\n\nImage use and copyright\n\n\nPolder Knowledge almost always uses original images in our blog posts. If you use an image, photo, or other design element made by someone outside Polder Knowledge, get permission first. Once you have permission, always give the copyright owner credit and link back to the original source.\n\n\nImages retrieved via Google image search are not licensed for fair use, but many images are available under license through stock photo websites, or open for use under a Creative Commons license. Flickr has a great search feature for images available under Creative Commons licenses.\n\n\nOther licenses\n\n\nCreative Commons licenses\n\n\nInstead of the standard \u201call rights reserved,\u201d some creators choose to make their work available for public use with different levels of attribution required. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with this style guide. Find a breakdown of licenses on the \nCreative Commons website\n.\n\n\nPlease check with Polder Knowledge\u2019s legal team before making something you created here available under a Creative Commons license. We love to share our work, but we use these licenses sparingly, because we have to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets.\n\n\nTrademarks\n\n\nA trademark, often called a mark, can be a word, name, sign, design, or a combination of those. It\u2019s used to identify the provider of a particular product or service. They\u2019re usually words and images, but in some cases, they can even be a \ncolor\n.\n\n\nTo be protectable, a trademark needs a distinctive element. There\u2019s a \u201cspectrum of distinctiveness\u201d that spans from inherently protectable marks to ones that require additional proof to ones that may never be protected.\n\n\n\n\nFanciful marks\n, which are made up words like Kodak or Xerox, are the most easily registered and protected.\n\n\nArbitrary marks\n, which are words which are used out of context like Apple or Sprite, are also easy to protect.\n\n\nSuggestive marks\n, which suggest at some element of the goods or services like Greyhound, follow.\n\n\nDescriptive marks\n, where the word's dictionary meaning aligns with the goods or services offered, like Mr. Plumber or Lektronic, are not protectable unless they develop a secondary meaning. That means a consumer would immediately associate the mark with only that good or service. This can be hard to prove, so it's best to avoid descriptive marks when possible.\n\n\nGeneric terms\n, or the common name for a product or service, are not protectable.\n\n\n\n\nWe usually classify Polder Knowledge as a suggestive mark, but it could also be considered fanciful.\n\n\nA trademark is only valid for as long as it indicates the source of that good or service, so we have to be very careful about how our marks are used. We send out cease and desist letters sometimes, because even the friendliest companies have to protect their trademarks. If a trademark is properly protected, it can last forever and may be a company's most valuable asset.",

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for licensors:\n Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. \nMore considerations for licensors\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for the public:\n By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor\u2019s permission is not necessary for any reason\u2013for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright\u2013then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. \nMore considerations for the public\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 \u2013 Definitions.\n\n\na. \nAdapted Material\n means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n\nb. \nAdapter's License\n means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nc. \nCopyright and Similar Rights\n means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nd. \nEffective Technological Measures\n means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\n\ne. \nExceptions and Limitations\n means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n\nf. \nLicensed Material\n means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\n\ng. \nLicensed Rights\n means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n\nh. \nLicensor\n means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\n\ni. \nNonCommercial\n means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.\n\n\nj. \nShare\n means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\n\nk. \nSui Generis Database Rights\n means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n\nl. \nYou\n means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 \u2013 Scope.\n\n\na. \nLicense grant.\n\n\n1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n    A. __Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n    B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n\n\n\nb. \nOther rights.\n\n\n1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\n\n\n\nSection 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n\na. \nAttribution.\n\n\n1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n        i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n        ii. a copyright notice;\n\n        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n        v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\n\n\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;\n\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n\na. \nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\n\nb. \nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n\n1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n\n\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n```\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \u201cLicensor.\u201d Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at \ncreativecommons.org/policies\n, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \u201cCreative Commons\u201d or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

            "text": "Polder Knowledge MkDocs Theme\n\n\nThis repository contains the MkDocs theme proposed for Polder Knowledge\ndocumentation.\n\n\nIt is forked from the dist-build of the \nZF theme\n\ntheme, by the Zend Framework team. All credits go to them, we modified the theme for our needs.\n\n\nThe theme itself resides in \ntheme/\n. Also included are tools for building and\ndeploying documentation.\n\n\ngh-pages automation\n\n\nTo automate GitHub Pages builds, you will need to update the \n.travis.yml\n file.\n\n\n1. Setup a personal access token\n\n\nYou'll need to setup a personal access token on GitHub. You can do this\nfrom your \nSettings\n page; access the \nPersonal access tokens\n screen, generate\na new token, and copy it once generated; this will be the only time GitHub will\nshow it to you! When you create it, give it only the \npublic_repo\n scope.\n\n\n2. Encrypt the token for use with Travis\n\n\nNext, we'll encrypt that token for use with Travis. You'll need to install the\nTravis CLI tool, which is detailed on their \nEnvironment Variables page\n.\nOnce you have installed the tool and logged in for the first time, run the\nfollowing:\n\n\n$ travis encrypt -r \norg\n/\nrepo\n GH_TOKEN=\ntoken\n\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the output into the \nenv\n section of your \n.travis.yml\n:\n\n\nenv:\n  global:\n    - secure: \n...\n\n\n\n\n3. Setup global environment variables\n\n\nThese scripts require a few environment variables in order to work:\n\n\n\n\nSITE_URL\n\n\nGH_USER_NAME\n (Full name of user associated with GitHub token used to push\n  documentation)\n\n\nGH_USER_EMAIL\n (Email address associated with GitHub token used to push\n  documentation)\n\n\nGH_REF\n The host and path, minus the scheme, to the git repository; e.g.\n  \ngithub.com/zendframework/zend-expressive.git\n\n\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\nenv:\n  global:\n    - SITE_URL=\nhttps://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive\n\n    - GH_USER_NAME=\nMatthew Weier O'Phinney\n\n    - GH_USER_EMAIL=\nmatthew@\ndomain\n.\ntld\n\n    - GH_REF=\ngithub.com/zendframework/zend-expressive.git\n\n    - secure: \n...\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n all environment variables use the \nKEY=VALUE\n format, while the \nsecure\n key (which is not an actual environment variable) uses the \nKEY: VALUE\n format. \n\n\n4. Choose a build for deployment\n\n\nYou should only deploy documentation from a single build job. To do that, we'll\nadd an environment variable to a single build; on success, that build will then\nbuild and deploy the documentation. We usually use the latest PHP 5 version for\nthis.\n\n\nWhen determining when to build, we only want to build when:\n\n\n\n\non the master branch\n\n\nif it's not a pull request\n\n\n\n\nFinally, MkDocs and its extensions are installed under the user, in\n\n$HOME/.local/bin\n, so we want to add that to the path when we're on a build\nthat deploys.\n\n\nThefollowing shows an example of the changes necessary, under the 5.6 build:\n\n\nmatrix:\n  fast_finish: true\n  include:\n    - php: 5.6\n      env:\n        - DEPLOY_DOCS=\n$(if [[ $TRAVIS_BRANCH == 'master' \n $TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST == 'false' ]]; then echo -n 'true' ; else echo -n 'false' ; fi)\n\n        - PATH=\n$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\n\n    - php: 7\n    - php: hhvm\n  allow_failures:\n    - php: hhvm\n\n\n\n\nWe'll use the \nDEPLOY_DOCS\n environment variable to determine if we need to\ndownload the them and build the documentation later.\n\n\n5. Conditionally download the theme and build tools\n\n\nIf the build is successful, we will want to make sure the theme and build tools\nare present. To do this, and ensure the assets downloaded can be cached, we need\nto do this as the last step of our \nscript\n, but \nonly\n if the rest of the build\nhas succeeded. We can test that with the \n$TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT\n variable.\n\n\nThis repository has a script for installing the repository itself; we'll fetch\nthat and execute it.\n\n\nThe results look like this:\n\n\nscript:\n  - \ndo something ...\n\n  - if [[ $DEPLOY_DOCS == \ntrue\n \n \n$TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT\n == \n0\n ]]; then travis_retry curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polderknowledge/mkdocs-theme/master/theme-installer.sh | bash ; fi\n\n\n\n\nThis will run the code to install MkDocs and its extensions, and, if the\nmkdoc-theme is not yet installed, download the latest version and install it.\n\n\n6. Build and deploy the documentation on success\n\n\nNow we'll add the \nafter_success\n script:\n\n\nafter_success:\n  - if [[ $DEPLOY_DOCS == \ntrue\n ]]; then ./mkdocs-theme/deploy.sh ; fi\n\n\n\n\nThe above runs \nonly\n if the build has been a success, and will not change the\nsuccess status.\n\n\n7. Add caching\n\n\nChances are that the component you're using is already caching Composer\ndependencies, so you'll likely already have a \ncache\n section to your\n\n.travis.yml\n. Regardless, you'll need entries for \n$HOME/.local\n and\n\nmkdoc-theme\n to speed up your builds:\n\n\ncache:\n  directories:\n    - $HOME/.local\n    - mkdocs-theme\n\n\n\n\nA note on caching\n\n\nIf you followed the steps above, you're caching the MkDocs installation and\nzf-mkdoc-theme installation between requests. What if it changes, and you want\nto pick up those changes?\n\n\nYou have two ways to clear the cache.\n\n\nFirst, you can go to the project's page on Travis-CI (e.g.,\nhttps://travis-ci.org/zendframework/zend-expressive). Once there, click the\n\"Settings\" dropdown on the right side of the screen, and select the \"Caches\"\nitem; this takes you to the page detailing all caches. Locate the one for the\n\"master\" branch, and hit the little rubbish bin icon to remove the cache.\n\n\nSecond, you can do it through the Travis-CI API, which is most easily accessed\nvia the \ntravis\n CLI tool\n. Once\nyou've installed it and setup your credentials, you can list the caches for the\nmaster branch with:\n\n\n$ travis cache -b master\n\n\n\n\nYou can remove the caches for master using:\n\n\n$ travis cache -b master --delete\n\n\n\n\nIt will prompt you to make certain that's what you want to do, and then list all\ncaches it deleted when complete.\n\n\nprism.js\n\n\nDocumentation utilizes prism.js for code snippets. The following options were\nselected when creating the CSS/JS used by the documentation via the\nhttp://prismjs.com/download.html page:\n\n\n\n\nMinified version\n\n\nOkaida theme\n\n\nMarkup\n\n\nCSS\n\n\nC-like\n\n\nJavaScript\n\n\nApache Configuration\n\n\nBash\n\n\nBatch\n\n\nCSS Extras\n\n\nDiff\n\n\nDocker\n\n\nGit\n\n\nHandlebars\n\n\nHTTP\n\n\nIni\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nLess\n\n\nMakefile\n\n\nMarkdown\n\n\nnginx\n\n\nPHP\n\n\nPHP Extras\n\n\nPowerShell\n\n\nPuppet\n\n\nSass (Sass)\n\n\nSass (Scss)\n\n\nSmarty\n\n\nSQL\n\n\nTwig\n\n\nvim\n\n\nYAML",

To learn more about sending us feedback or adapting this guide to create your own, see the Contributing file.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re forking this style guide, here are some formatting tips.\n\n\nCreating a New File\n\n\nThis guide is a collection of Markdown files. This is a plaintext format that easily converts to HTML. Read more about it \nhere\n. Be sure you name your files without spaces with an \n.md\n extension.\n\n\nThe files in this guide are prefixed with a double digit to set order. Make sure your file starts with a number that will place your new content in the desired position (eg: \n04-\n) and change the prefixes of the other files to reflect this change in order.\n\n\nMarkdown\n\n\nMarkdown is handy because you can write your content without HTML tags. Here are some tips to help you control the layout of your text.\n\n\nLine Breaks\n\n\nIf you want a line to break to the next line but don\u2019t want to start a new paragraph, end the line with two spaces. This will render a \nbr\n tag.\n\n\nWidows\n\n\nThe best way to prevent widows is to type \nnbsp;\n in the space between the last two words in a title or paragraph.\n\n\nTables\n\n\nTables can be written in Markdown by following this general style:\n\n\n| header 1 | header 2 |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| cell 1   | cell 2   |\n| cell 3   | cell 4   |\n\n\n\n\nThe spacing is not important for the table to be rendered properly, and the cells do not have to line up. However it does help with readability when creating and editing tables.\n\n\nHTML Tags in Text\n\n\nWhen displaying HTML tags as text in content, be sure to wrap them in backticks, eg: `\nh3\n`.",
